- [ ] custom fields
- [x] tags can have a color assigned to them (requires updating the SDKs) - partially done DB side, UI implementation
  must be done.
    - update tag UI to allow for assigning colors
    - update PHP & React SDK to return this value
    - update changelog entries display, changelog tag picker, changelog API to return tag color

- [x] pwnedpasswords password check
- [x] custom domains (what a headache to implement!)
- [x] scheduled publishing
- [x] full-text search
- [x] version range comparison (catch-up) thinking a digest of what's been done from here-to-there, could be fun!
- [ ] more changelog customization
    - set SEO for public changelog
    - custom scripting for public changelog ( custom js, CSS makes no sense due to changerawr being a CMS)
    - set a logo for your changelog
        - requirements:
        - media manager
        - storage providers (s3, local, maybe google drive not sure)
        - enables for reusable media that can be uploaded to the content editor.

- [ ] ability to specify a custom logo for an SSO provider (will be added when I get around to media storage!)
- [ ] update the MCP server so it can use scheduled publishing
- [ ] collaboration ( real time, this is complicated! )
- [ ] allow for inviting other staff members to work on the same changelog entry - collaboration
- [x] CLI for Changerawr
- [ ] do stuff with the syncCommit and syncCommitMetadata (no ideas what I could do as of writing)
- [x] extend markdown with custom elements (perhaps, can call it Changerawr Universal Markdown engine) - CUM
- [x] allow for importing a full changelog.md into changerawr to jump-start a project from existing data. look into
  canny importing as well.
- [x] add a configuration option for project email notifications to allow emails to be sent out on publish
- [x] allow users to bookmark the entry they are working on to their favorites
- [ ] upgrade to next 16
- [x] allow for manually setting a post's publishedAt date.
- [ ] add "user preferences" to public changelog pages so visitors can customize settings such as setting the theme. This is a major feature due to how the theme handler currently works. I am not looking forward to getting around to implementing this.

### CLI Ideas

- [ ] get all changelogs under .changerawr/changelogs/${date} via ( changerawr pull --skip-single-files )
- [ ] figure out if providing a **changerawr push** command is a good idea | add to **changerawr doctor** if implemented.

### Changerawr Universal Markdown Engine Ideas

- [ ] Support Subtext
- [ ] Support Tables
