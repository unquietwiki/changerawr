FEATURE GUARANTEE

Supernova Software, LLC guarantees that all features of Changerawr will remain free 
and accessible at no cost, regardless of future developments or service offerings. 
This guarantee applies to the core Software as distributed in the public repository.

The sole exception to this guarantee is if Supernova Software, LLC creates an official 
managed cloud hosting service. In such case, fees may be charged exclusively to cover:
- Server and infrastructure costs for the client's virtual private server (VPS)
- Management and maintenance services
- Service-based add-ons that do not affect the core Software functionality

Service-based add-ons are limited to operational services such as prioritized support, 
dedicated single sign-on (SSO) infrastructure, enhanced SLA agreements, or professional 
services. Add-ons will NEVER include software features, integrations, or functionality 
that affects the Changerawr core itself. All software features and integrations remain 
free in both self-hosted and any potential cloud offerings.

Any such cloud offering would be optional, and the self-hosted version of Changerawr 
would remain completely free with all features intact.
